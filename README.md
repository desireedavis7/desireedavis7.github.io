# About Me
### **Desiree Davis**   
Email: Dadavis1@my.waketech.edu  
This is my school Github Account.  
This repository will hold all of my assignments.  

My name is Desiree and I'm a mom to a busy 1 year old baby boy. I just started the Web Development program at Wake Tech after attempting to learn on my own over the years but needed more structure. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration a little over a decade ago but decided to go back to school for something I've always been interested in. I have always had a passion for designing creating graphics and designing websites. But now I hope to learn Full Stack Development so that I am able to build webpages and applications from scratch.
