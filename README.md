About Me:
My name is Desiree and I'm a mom to a busy baby boy. I just start the Web Development program at Wake Tech after attempting to learn on my own over the years but needed more structure. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration a little over a decade ago but decided to go back to school for something I've always been interested in. I love building things digitally and physically, so I'm super optimistic to learn everything I can. I love nature and enjoy painting and gardening in my free time!
